# COVID-19
COVID-19 data analysis project.

For this project I used the John Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset, available at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data. This dataset contains daily COVID-19 statistics from the US and around the world going all the way back to early 2020. A detailed description of the dataset is available in the dataset GitHub repository at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

The goal was to provide 2-4 interesting summaries, takeaways, or trends in the data and present these using visualizations, tables, or another appropriate format, along with a short narrative.
